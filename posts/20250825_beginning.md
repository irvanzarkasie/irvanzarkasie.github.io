# I Want People to Know Me but I am Really Really Afraid to be Seen or Heard

August 25th, 2025

That might sound confusing, but you read it right. I have been really really afraid of two things:
1. I am affraid to be seen (or heard)
2. I am affraid to die alone

I am not sure if I will be somewhat seen or heard, but I am very certain that everyone's life will eventually end. So I guess my second fear is a much bigger issue to be considered here.

So there you have it. This is my attempt to avoid dying alone and be forgotten afterwards. I will overcome my fear of dying alone by overcoming my fear to be seen or heard. But since I want to make myself seen or heard, how should I look or sound? How should I present myself? Do I expect to be seen (or heard) in some particular ways?
